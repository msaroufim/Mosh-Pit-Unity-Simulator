# Mosh pit simulator in Unity

This is a simple Unity project I hacked together in a morning. The goal is to run away from the metalheads.


## Things you can learn from this repo
* How to setup an enemy spawner script
* How to setup an audio source (Amon Amarth in our case - Notice: I did not make this music nor am I using this project for any commercial purposes)
* How to setup a character controller
* How to create a simple environment

## TODO
* Add a simple jump mechanic
* Powerups
